I try to follow GitOps and treat all infrastructure as code, this Homelab uses a combination of Packer VM templates, OpenTofu for provisioning VM's, Docker for running everything, Ansible for running playbooks on all hosts at once, and Actions for automating repeated tasks. That being said this is a mixed repository for various sorts of purposes and thus there is no easy way to get started. This is not a project that can be easily copy/pasted and am only posting this for the philosophies and techniques used in a Homelab.
